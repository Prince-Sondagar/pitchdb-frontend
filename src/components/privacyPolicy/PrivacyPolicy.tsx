      <h2>Data Usage Policy</h2>
      <p>
        PitchDB, LLC (“PitchDB”, “we” or “us”) recognizes the importance of privacy for our
        customers and users. We want to be transparent about how we collect and use information in
        connection with the website PitchDB.com (the “Site”) and any service offered by the company,
        provided in connection with the Site or otherwise (the “Services”). Thus, we developed a
        data usage policy (the “Data Usage Policy”) that applies to the Site and Services, and this
        is incorporated by reference into the Site Terms of Use accessible&nbsp;
        <a href="https://pitchdb.com/terms-and-conditions/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In this Data Usage Policy, we’ll often refer to “Personal Information”. This is information
        that identifies (directly or indirectly) a particular individual. Personal Information may
        include (without limitation) your first name, last name and email address, and you may
        provide Personal Information to us in many ways including on our forms, surveys,
        applications or during account creation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In this Data Usage Policy, when we refer to “you” or “your”, we mean any person accessing
        the Site. If the person accessing this Site acts on behalf of another person or entity,
        “you” or “your” also means that other person or entity. By submitting Personal Information
        through the Site or Services, you are providing your permission and consent for the
        collection, use, retention and disclosure of Personal Information as set forth in this
        Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>The Privacy Policy describes the following:</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          How we collect information (including Personal Information) and what types of information
          we collect
        </li>
        <li>How we use and safeguard Personal Information</li>
        <li>
          Your rights and choices regarding how Personal Information may be used and disclosed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        Before we discuss the types of information we collect, please note that use of our Site and
        Services is strictly limited to persons who have attained the age of majority in the
        jurisdiction in which they reside; you must be at least eighteen (18) years old to use our
        Site and Services in any jurisdiction. PitchDB does not knowingly collect or store any
        Personal Information or any information from any persons under the age of 13. &nbsp;If
        PitchDB discovers that Personal Information of persons under 13 years of age has been
        collected or stored, PitchDB will take the appropriate steps to delete this information from
        our systems.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>I.Information We Collect</p>
      <br />
      <p>Information You Provide Voluntarily to Us</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We collect Personal Information from you directly. For example, we may obtain Personal
        Information when you request information, products or services from or otherwise interact
        with the Site or Services, or fill out a Registration Form.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also collect Personal Information through your access to your accounts online, as
        well as your asking questions through our “Contact Us” link, such as your name, address,
        e-mail address and other contact information. We may also collect data resulting from your
        activity on the Site, such as transaction information.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Information We Collect Automatically</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We collect navigational information about where visitors go on our Site and information
        about the technical efficiencies of our Site and Services. In the process of gathering
        navigational information, anonymous information may be collected which will provide
        information to us regarding use of our Site. Anonymous information is information that does
        not directly or indirectly identify, or cannot reasonably be used to identify, a particular
        individual. Examples of anonymous information may include information about your Internet
        browser, domain type, usage statistics, and service provider, collected through tracking
        technologies and aggregated or de-identified data.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We may also collect anonymized location information or your IP address for analytics
        purposes, and we may authorize third parties to do so. This information may be collected
        from your mobile device’s location-aware features when you request certain services that are
        dependent on your physical location.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Depending on how you access and use our Site and Services, you may use a browser feature
        known as a &#8220;cookie.&#8221; A cookie is a piece of data stored on the computer that
        runs an Internet browser and is commonly used to store information about a user’s online
        activities, including information such as the content or advertisements that a user views or
        the pages a user visits within a particular website. A cookie can contain information about
        you, your computer, your browser, your session, the websites you visit and other information
        about you or others who use, or have used, the computer or browser you use to access the
        Internet. Cookies are used for record-keeping purposes: the stored information can be
        retrieved by our website server when you return to the website. This allows us to
        personalize or regulate the use of this Site, and it also permits us to automate the access
        and data entry functions of this Site (e.g., login information), and to tailor the
        appearance or presentation of this Site to your preferences or interests.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand how our Site is
        used, and to improve the content and offerings on our Site. For example, we may use cookies
        to personalize your experience at our web pages or recall your specific information on
        subsequent visits (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our Site). We may also
        use cookies to offer you or inform you of products, programs or services and targeted
        advertising. You can opt to have your browser reject cookies.

      <p>Do Not Track</p>
      <p>
        PitchDB does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide
        targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals or other
        mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of
        Personal Information about an individual consumer&#8217;s online activities over time and
        across third-party Web sites or online services. Accordingly, your selection of the “Do Not
        Track” option provided by your browser may not have any effect on our analytics or tracking
        tools. Use the “Help” feature of your browser to obtain more information about refusing
        cookies. If you set the browser you use to reject cookies, you may not be able to access the
        Site or use the full functionality of the Site, or it may take additional time to utilize
        such functionality. If you opt to reject cookies, you may need to re-register with us every
        time you visit our Site. Your continued use of our Site reflects your consent to allow
        additional cookies to be placed on your computer to help you navigate the Site.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Pixel Tags, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        These are typically small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the Site, our
        applications or certain e-mail communications that we send to you. They may involve the
        transmission of information directly to us, to another party on our behalf or to another
        party in accordance with its privacy policy. We may use these technologies to track your
        engagement with our application or our marketing messages.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Clickstream Data</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each website you
        visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as “clickstream data,” can be
        collected and stored by a website’s server. Clickstream data can identify the type of
        computer and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked
        to the Site. We may use clickstream data as a form of non-Personal Information to
        anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of the Site, how visitors
        navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of
        visitors.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Log Files</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        PitchDB or our hosting provider may collect traffic information from visitors for
        statistical analysis and Site improvement. When you access the Site, we (or our hosting
        provider) may collect information about your visit in a log file on a server. Log file
        information may include, but is not limited to, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser
        type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp,
        and number of clicks. We (or our hosting provider) use this information to analyze trends,
        administer sites, track users’ movements in the aggregate, and gather demographic
        information for aggregate use. We (or our hosting provider) may review this information to
        better understand overall trends and to determine what kinds of content are popular with and
        useful to users.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Information Other Websites Collect from You</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our Site may contain links to other websites operated by other parties whose practices may
        be different than ours. When you click on such links and visit such other websites, you need
        to be aware that we may not control such other websites or such other websites’ business
        practices, and that this Privacy Policy does not apply to such other websites. Consequently,
        the operators of such other websites may collect different kinds of information about you
        and may use and disclose that information in different ways than we would if it were
        collected on the Site.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>II.How We Use Information</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We may use your Personal Information to help&nbsp;us improve our product and service
        offerings, improve the Site’s functionality process queries on the Site, to contact you when
        necessary in connection with products or services you accessed or inquired about via the
        Site (i.e. troubleshooting your account), to provide you with account login credentials, and
        to send you information, offers and other promotional materials from us and selected third
        parties. &nbsp;We may also use your information for analytics purposes to assist us in
        understanding how you use the Site or Services and to improve our Site or Services. Below is
        how we use specific categories of Personal Information.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>E-mail Address</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We may use your e-mail address to provide customer service information or answer your
        questions and requests. We may also occasionally send you our e-mail updates, notifications
        or other information about our products and services or about the products and services of
        our affiliated companies. We include information in each commercial email that allows you to
        opt out of receiving future communications.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Financial Information</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        By engaging in any kind of activity on the Site that uses financial information, you consent
        to our using your financial information, including credit card information, or providing
        your financial information to our service providers and to such third parties as we
        determine is necessary, to process your transactions. These third parties may include
        banking institutions used to process these transactions. Any of these various third parties
        are authorized to use your financial information in accordance with our contractual
        arrangements with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over
        which we have no control.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Demographic Information</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We may use demographic information to tailor the Site and communications to the interests of
        our users.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Third-Party Email Account Syncing</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        PitchDB allows you to connect our Services to your various third-party email accounts (such
        as Gmail) for the purpose of sending email and for us to check your inbox for replies and
        bounces. We require a small set of permissions on your third-party email account to be able
        to do this and will only use it for the purpose of providing you with our Services or for
        diagnosing issues related to your third-party email account. &nbsp;PitchDB will not use your
        email account information for any purpose other than providing the Services to you. PitchDB
        is not responsible for any issues related to your third-party email account.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Permissions we require for connected Google accounts:</p>
      <br />
      <p>“View your email messages and settings”</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          PitchDB will access your basic profile information including photo, name, and email
          address so that we can properly label your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          PitchDB will periodically check your inbox for messages. Our app will check your inbox to
          find replies to emails sent by your PitchDB campaigns in order to present this information
          to you within the PitchDB application, turn recipients into leads as necessary, and stop
          follow-up messages from sending when a reply causes someone to become a lead. We also look
          for unsubscribe requests and bounces to emails sent by PitchDB to keep your contact lists
          up to date and help you with deliverability.
        </li>
        <li>
          In rare cases, our engineers may use an internal tool to attempt to locate emails related
          to your PitchDB campaigns to either resolve a support request you submitted, to solve a
          bug, or to investigate a potential security issue. This is always done in such a manner
          that the engineers view the least amount of information possible.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>“Send email on your behalf”</p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>PitchDB needs this permission to be able to run your campaigns.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>III.Disclosure of Information</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose information about your
        individual visits to our site, or Personal Information that you provide to any outside
        parties, except when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to
        (i) comply with any law, or (ii) protect the rights, property or safety of PitchDB, our
        users or third parties.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Disclosure to Agents</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We may provide information about you (including your Personal Information) that you have
        provided to us through the Site to third parties (“Agents”) that provide services to help us
        with our business activities such as to host or maintain our Site; for data processing
        services; to provide website or data security; to provide operational, analytical or
        reporting services; or to provide technical support. In connection with providing those
        services to PitchDB, an Agent may have access to your Personal Information, but such
        Personal Information will be disclosed to Agents in a manner consistent with our Data
        Security processes, will not be used for any purpose other than as PitchDB authorizes, and
        it will not be disclosed by the Agents to any third party.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Disclosure to Legal Authorities</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        PitchDB may disclose your Personal Information when required by subpoena, court order or
        other legal process, or if it has a good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (a)
        comply with any applicable federal, state or local law or regulation, (b) assist government
        enforcement agencies, (c) investigate, prevent or take action in connection with suspected
        or actual illegal activities, (d) investigate suspected or actual violations of PitchDB’s
        rights, (e) protect the rights, property or safety of PitchDB and its customers or
        employees, or others, (f) investigate and defend against any third-party claims brought

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Disclosure for Corporate Transactions</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We consider the information that you provide to us to be a business asset. Accordingly,
        PitchDB may &nbsp;disclose Personal Information and other information about you to a third
        party in connection with the sale, assignment or transfer of some or all of the assets of
        PitchDB or as the result of a change in control of PitchDB, in which case we will require
        any such third party to treat any such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy
        Policy. Any such third party to whom PitchDB sells, assigns or transfers PitchDB’s assets
        will have the right to use the Personal Information and other information that you have
        provided to us.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Disclosure of Anonymized Information</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        PitchDB reserves the right to use and disclose anonymized information, aggregated
        information or publicly available information that has not been combined with nonpublic
        Personal Information for any purposes including without limitation PitchDB’s internal use
        and research.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, PitchDB will not disclose information, even in anonymized, aggregate, or derivative
        forms, that is made available by our connection to email providers such as Gmail, including
        API calls relating to checking, reading, or sending email, in accordance with the&nbsp;
        <a
          href="//developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional-requirements-for-specific-api-scopes"
          target="_blank"

        >
          Additional Requirements for Restricted Scopes
        </a>
        &nbsp;as specified by Google. When connecting to email providers such as Gmail, PitchDB will
        only make use of the information necessary to render our service so that we can display our
        user interface and perform requested actions on your account.

        parties modify their account settings, as you may have chosen to receive promotional
        materials in the account registration process. If you are still receiving promotional
        materials 30 days after modifying your account settings to no longer receive such emails,
        you may contact us directly using the information below and we will use commercially
        reasonable efforts to comply with &nbsp;changes you request. Note that our compliance with
        such requests in certain cases may involve batch processing and other processes that take 30
        days or longer. If you require an immediate change to your Personal Information and are
        unable to make such a change using the available Site resources, please contact us. If you
        opt not to receive such communications or to allow us to share your information and then you
        give your Personal Information to us again by using the Site or under other circumstances
        that permit us to use your information, we will regard your opt-out as having been
        rescinded. Also, please note that users may not necessarily opt out of receiving all

      <br />
      <p>
        PitchDB takes reasonable precautions to protect Personal Information provided to us through
        the Site from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
        PitchDB has put in place reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and managerial

      <p>
        Particularly sensitive information is encrypted. You can usually tell whether encryption is
        being used by noting the “locked” or other status indicator on the browser you are using. If
        the browser you are using does not indicate that the session is secure (e.g., by displaying
        a lock, a key or a similar icon), you should assume that the connection is not secure and
        that third parties will receive the information shared by you and us during that part of the
        session. Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computer networks that may
        be located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in
        which you reside, and the country or jurisdiction in which these computer networks are
        located may not have privacy laws as protective as the laws in your country or jurisdiction.

          cloud (VPC)
        </li>
        <li>
          Tight security rules are in place to allow only the minimal points of access to our VPC
